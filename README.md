#Simple countdown

**NOTE:** This is not my original code. 

I found this snippet on a website titled [Dev Ingredients](http://devingredients.com/2011/11/)building-an-extensible-jquery-countdown-plugin-from-scratch
Dev Ingredients is managed by *Catalin Berta*. 

##How to call function

`setCountdown(now,endDate)`

**now** can be actual server date, but in this case as example was used client actual date, using this jQuery code `$.now()`

**endDate** must have this format `"28 april 2017 12:00:00"`
